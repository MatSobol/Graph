# Graph
Program that does simple actions on graphs.

You can use programs like Intelij IDE to lunch.

Or you can use maven package. Once finished you can lunch this program with simple command: java -jar target/jpong-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar.

You can test this program with maven test.
